# Hey there from earth, I'm Asterio aka Astervista

I am a software engineer currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

My main interests are in front-end development, UX design, computer graphics and graphic design, but also complex systems design; I also enjoy building IoT systems. 

Some of my other interests are in Photography, digital media, divulgation and entertainment, travel. 

I also really like making my life hard by being a stubborn perfectionist. Also, 110% queer 🏳️‍🌈 and activist
